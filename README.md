This project is a simple calculator that can perform the 4 basic operations.

It was created as an exercise for the Odin Project in an effort to sharpen and strengthen my JavaScript knowledge.

The calculator is styled in the fashion of Windows 95 thanks to the CSS library found here: https://github.com/jdan/98.css
